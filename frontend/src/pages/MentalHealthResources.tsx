                    Women's mental health is influenced by a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors. Hormonal fluctuations
                    throughout the menstrual cycle, during pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause can significantly impact mood and emotional well-being.
                    Additionally, women often face unique societal pressures, including balancing multiple roles, gender discrimination, and higher rates
                    of certain types of trauma.

                    Research shows that women are more likely than men to experience certain mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety,
                    PTSD, and eating disorders. However, women also tend to have stronger social support networks and are often more willing to seek help,
                    which can be protective factors for mental health.
